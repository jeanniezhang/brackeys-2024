  - My, there's just so much to do today, Joy! There's hardly any food in the pantry
    so we better go GROCERY shopping.
  - Oh, and this light's been bugged out all day! We have to find a LIGHTBULB and
    fix it.
  - And oh, oh, and can you stop by the BOOKSTORE for me? We've been reading the
    same bedtime story for years!
